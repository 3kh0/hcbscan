- Card viewer page
- Auto index organzations
- Caching of data from HCB (stored on supabase, would make site much much faster)
- Search by user
- Pretty print recent action types
- Setup a image proxy to load images much faster (tried wsrv.nl but many things broke with it)
- View more page for transactions on orgs
- Analytics opt out
- Activities in past 24 hours countdown
- Animations???
- Public API for other functions (eg total value held by hcb) (kinda already out, but make it more offical instead of scraping my db)
- First class intergrations with HCB (work required)
