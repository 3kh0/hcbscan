## About

HCBScan is an open-source explorer for [HCB](https://hcb.hackclub.com/) that allows you to search for organizations, view transactions, and explore public financial data. It is built using [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org) with a little help from [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and it uses the [HCB API](https://hcb.hackclub.com/docs/api/v3) to fetch data.

## Local Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- pnpm
- A browser made within the past decade

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/3kh0/hcbscan.git
cd hcbscan
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

2. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`

## Configuration

### Supabase

HCBScan uses Supabase for some added functions. If you want to bring your own database and not use the default one, you can edit the [`utils/supabase.js`](utils/supabase.js) file with your own Supabase URL and public key.

### Third Party instances

HCB is open source and HCBScan supports third-party instances. If you want to use a different instance, you can edit the [`utils/apiConfig.js`](utils/apiConfig.js) to change the default HCB API URL to your desired instance.

By default, it uses the official HCB API.

## Deployment

HCBScan is built on Nuxt, which means it runs pretty much everywhere. Cloudflare Pages is recommended as it is the easiest to setup and use, all while being free.
